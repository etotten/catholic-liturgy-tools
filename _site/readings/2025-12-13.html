        <h2 class="reading-title">Reading 1 (Sirach 48:1-4, 9-11)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>In those days, like a fire there appeared the prophet Elijah whose words were as a flaming furnace. Their staff of bread he shattered, in his zeal he reduced them to straits; By the Lord&#x27;s word he shut up the heavens and three times brought down fire. How awesome are you, Elijah, in your wondrous deeds! Whose glory is equal to yours? You were taken aloft in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot with fiery horses. You were destined, it is written, in time to come to put an end to wrath before the day of the LORD, To turn back the hearts of fathers toward their sons, and to re-establish the tribes of Jacob. Blessed is he who shall have seen you and who falls asleep in your friendship.</p>

        <h2 class="reading-title">Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 80:2ac and 3b, 15-16, 18-19)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>R. (4) Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved. O shepherd of Israel, hearken, From your throne upon the cherubim, shine forth. Rouse your power. R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved. Once again, O LORD of hosts, look down from heaven, and see; Take care of this vine, and protect what your right hand has planted the son of man whom you yourself made strong. R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved. May your help be with the man of your right hand, with the son of man whom you yourself made strong. Then we will no more withdraw from you; give us new life, and we will call upon your name. R. Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved.</p>

        <h2 class="reading-title">Gospel (Matthew 17:9a, 10-13)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>As they were coming down from the mountain, the disciples asked Jesus, &quot;Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&quot; He said in reply, &quot;Elijah will indeed come and restore all things; but I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.&quot; Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</p>
