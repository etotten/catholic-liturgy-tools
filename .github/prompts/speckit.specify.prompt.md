- publish a hello world message using a github action to github site page (using Jekyll)
	- initially this message will just be the date in YYYY-MM-DD and "Hello Catholic World"
	- each day's message should be on it's own page which is linked from the index page
	- the published message should be in markdown format
	- provide a CLI to kickoff the runs, both via github actions (i.e. fully end-to-end) and directly via invoking the python scripts.
