            <p>King Antiochus was traversing the inland provinces; he heard that in Persia there was a city called Elymais, famous for its wealth in silver and gold, and that its temple was very rich, containing gold helmets, breastplates, and weapons left there by Alexander, son of Philip, king of Macedon, the first king of the Greeks.</p>
            <p>When the king heard this news, he was struck with fear and very much shaken. Sick with grief because his designs had failed, he took to his bed. There he remained many days, overwhelmed with sorrow, for he knew he was going to die.</p>

        <h2 class="reading-title">Gospel (Luke 20:27-40)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>Some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, came forward to pose this problem to Jesus, saying, &quot;Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If someones brother dies leaving a wife but no child, his brother must take the wife and raise up descendants for his brother.&quot;</p>
            <p>Jesus said to them, &quot;The children of this age marry and remarry; but those who are deemed worthy to attain to the coming age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. They can no longer die, for they are like angels; and they are the children of God because they are the ones who will rise. That the dead will rise even Moses made known in the passage about the bush, when he called out Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.&quot;</p>
