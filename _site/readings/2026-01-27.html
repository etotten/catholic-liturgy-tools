        <h2 class="reading-title">Reading 1 (2 Samuel 6:12b-15, 17-19)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>David went to bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David amid festivities. As soon as the bearers of the ark of the LORD had advanced six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. Then David, girt with a linen apron, came dancing before the LORD with abandon, as he and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with shouts of joy and to the sound of the horn. The ark of the LORD was brought in and set in its place within the tent David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. When he finished making these offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. He then distributed among all the people, to each man and each woman in the entire multitude of Israel, a loaf of bread, a cut of roast meat, and a raisin cake. With this, all the people left for their homes.</p>

            <p>The mother of Jesus and his brothers arrived at the house. Standing outside, they sent word to Jesus and called him. A crowd seated around him told him, &quot;Your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside asking for you.&quot; But he said to them in reply, &quot;Who are my mother and my brothers?&quot; And looking around at those seated in the circle he said, &quot;Here are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.&quot;</p>
