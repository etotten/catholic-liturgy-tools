            <p>The LORD said to Moses: “Speak to Aaron and his sons and tell them: This is how you shall bless the Israelites. Say to them: The LORD bless you and keep you! The LORD let his face shine upon you, and be gracious to you! The LORD look upon you kindly and give you peace! So shall they invoke my name upon the Israelites, and I will bless them.”</p>

        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>R. (2a) May God bless us in his mercy. May God have pity on us and bless us; may he let his face shine upon us. So may your way be known upon earth; among all nations, your salvation. R. May God bless us in his mercy. May the nations be glad and exult because you rule the peoples in equity; the nations on the earth you guide. R. May God bless us in his mercy. May the peoples praise you, O God; may all the peoples praise you! May God bless us, and may all the ends of the earth fear him! R. May God bless us in his mercy.</p>

        <h2 class="reading-title">Reading II (Galatians 4:4-7)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>Brothers and sisters: When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to ransom those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. As proof that you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” So you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son then also an heir, through God.</p>

        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>The shepherds went in haste to Bethlehem and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known the message that had been told them about this child. All who heard it were amazed by what had been told them by the shepherds. And Mary kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart. Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them. When eight days were completed for his circumcision, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
