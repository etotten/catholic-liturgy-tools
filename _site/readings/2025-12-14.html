    <h1>Third Sunday of Advent</h1>
    <p class="date">Sunday, December 14, 2025</p>
    
    <div class="reading-entry">
        <h2 class="reading-title">Reading 1 (Isaiah 35:1-6a, 10)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>The desert and the parched land will exult; the steppe will rejoice and bloom. They will bloom with abundant flowers, and rejoice with joyful song. The glory of Lebanon will be given to them, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God. Strengthen the hands that are feeble, make firm the knees that are weak, say to those whose hearts are frightened: Be strong, fear not! Here is your God, he comes with vindication; with divine recompense he comes to save you. Then will the eyes of the blind be opened, the ears of the deaf be cleared; then will the lame leap like a stag, then the tongue of the mute will sing. Those whom the LORD has ransomed will return and enter Zion singing, crowned with everlasting joy; they will meet with joy and gladness, sorrow and mourning will flee.</p>

    <div class="reading-entry">
        <h2 class="reading-title">Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 146:6-7, 8-9, 9-10.)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>R. (cf. Is 35:4) Lord, come and save us. or: R. Alleluia. The LORD God keeps faith forever, secures justice for the oppressed, gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets captives free. R. Lord, come and save us. or: R. Alleluia. The LORD gives sight to the blind; the LORD raises up those who were bowed down. The LORD loves the just; the LORD protects strangers. R. Lord, come and save us. or: R. Alleluia. The fatherless and the widow he sustains, but the way of the wicked he thwarts. The LORD shall reign forever; your God, O Zion, through all generations. R. Lord, come and save us. or: R. Alleluia.</p>

    <div class="reading-entry">
        <h2 class="reading-title">Reading 2 (James 5:7-10)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>Be patient, brothers and sisters, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains. You too must be patient. Make your hearts firm, because the coming of the Lord is at hand. Do not complain, brothers and sisters, about one another, that you may not be judged. Behold, the Judge is standing before the gates. Take as an example of hardship and patience, brothers and sisters, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</p>

    <div class="reading-entry">
        <h2 class="reading-title">Alleluia (Isaiah 61:1 (cited in Lk 4:18))</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>R. Alleluia, alleluia. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring glad tidings to the poor. R. Alleluia, alleluia.</p>

    <div class="reading-entry">
        <h2 class="reading-title">Gospel (Matthew 11:2-11)</h2>
        <div class="reading-text">
            <p>When John the Baptist heard in prison of the works of the Christ, he sent his disciples to Jesus with this question, &quot;Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?&quot; Jesus said to them in reply, &quot;Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them. And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me.&quot; As they were going off, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, &quot;What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? Then what did you go out to see? Someone dressed in fine clothing? Those who wear fine clothing are in royal palaces. Then why did you go out?  To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way before you. Amen, I say to you, among those born of women there has been none greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.&quot;</p>
