- software development:
    - the preferred language is python 3.11 for most things, unless something would be much more convenient in a different language
    - unit test coverage is at least 90% and is checked with each phase
    - e2e tests should always exist for CLI options
    - a CLI should be kept up to date with features for easy manual verification and/or experimentation
    - Each release must adhere to semantic versioning for the project as a whole, and the constitution must specify how version bumps are determined.
    - For iterating, we must ensure that we focus on thin slices of functionality that can be built upon, rather than trying to build everything at once.
- stay simple; keep things minimal, allow for complexity to grow only as needed:
    - I don't want to generate an enormous amount of code; keep things simple; stick to the requirements given, don't wander off script
    - At this early stage, we don't need multilingual support; English only is fine for now
    - At this early stage, we don't need accessibility features; focus on core functionality for now
    - At this early stage, don't worry about performance optimizations; prioritize correctness and clarity
- constitution governance:
    - I do expect to change this constitution over time, but at this early stage, the ammendment process can be as simple and informal as possible; but whatever version of the constitution we have should be followed strictly.
- catholic liturgy:
    - All liturgical content MUST derive from authoritative Catholic sources
